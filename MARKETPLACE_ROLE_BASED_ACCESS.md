# Marketplace Role-Based Access Implementation

## Issue Identified
The marketplace was hardcoded to use the admin products endpoint (`/api/admin/products/summary`) regardless of user role, causing:
- **Admin users**: Could see products but couldn't add them to cart
- **Buyer users**: Might not see products if they lacked admin access
- **Other users**: Could see products but couldn't interact properly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Role-Aware Product Fetching**
The marketplace now uses different endpoints based on user role:

```javascript
// Use different endpoints based on user role
let endpoint = 'http://localhost:8080/api/admin/products/summary';

if (isBuyer) {
  endpoint = 'http://localhost:8080/api/buyer/products';
} else if (isAdmin) {
  endpoint = 'http://localhost:8080/api/admin/products/summary';
} else {
  // For other roles or unauthenticated users, try public endpoint
  endpoint = 'http://localhost:8080/api/warehouse/marketplace/products';
}
```

### 2. **Role-Based Button Display**
Different buttons are shown based on user role:

- **ðŸ›’ Buyer Users**: See "Add to Cart" buttons (functional)
- **ðŸ‘‘ Admin Users**: See "Manage Product" buttons (for product management)
- **ðŸ‘€ Guest/Other Users**: See "Login as Buyer to Shop" buttons (disabled)

### 3. **Visual Role Indicators**
Added a banner showing the current user's view mode:
- **Admin View**: "You can browse and manage products"
- **Buyer View**: "You can add items to cart and shop"
- **Guest View**: "You can browse products only"

## API Endpoints Used

| User Role | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **BUYER** | `/api/buyer/products` | Get products for shopping |
| **ADMIN** | `/api/admin/products/summary` | Get products for management |
| **OTHERS** | `/api/warehouse/marketplace/products` | Public product browsing |

## Benefits

âœ… **Better User Experience**: Users see appropriate actions for their role  
âœ… **Proper Access Control**: Each role gets relevant functionality  
âœ… **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users understand what they can do  
âœ… **Flexible Product Sources**: Different endpoints for different needs  

## Testing Scenarios

### Admin User
- Should see products from admin endpoint
- Should see "Manage Product" buttons
- Should see "Admin View" banner
- Cannot add items to cart

### Buyer User  
- Should see products from buyer endpoint
- Should see "Add to Cart" buttons
- Should see "Buyer View" banner
- Can add items to cart and shop

### Guest/Other Users
- Should see products from public endpoint
- Should see "Login as Buyer to Shop" buttons
- Should see "Guest View" banner
- Cannot add items to cart

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/marketplace/Marketplace.jsx`
  - Added role-based product fetching
  - Added role-based button display
  - Added role indicator banner
  - Updated useEffect dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Test with different user roles** to ensure proper functionality
2. **Verify API endpoints** are working for each role
3. **Add product management functionality** for admin users
4. **Implement proper error handling** for failed API calls
5. **Add loading states** for different endpoints
