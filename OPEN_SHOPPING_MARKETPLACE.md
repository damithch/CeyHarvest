# Open Shopping Marketplace Implementation

## New Shopping Model

The marketplace now follows an **open shopping model** where:

✅ **Anyone can view products** (guests, farmers, buyers, admins, etc.)  
✅ **Anyone can add items to cart** (after logging in)  
✅ **Farmers and buyers can complete purchases**  
❌ **Admins cannot purchase products** (management only)  

## User Access Levels

### 👀 **Guest Users (Not Logged In)**
- Can view all products
- Cannot add to cart (redirected to login)
- Cannot complete purchases

### 🛒 **Shopping Users (Buyers, Farmers, etc.)**
- Can view all products
- Can add items to cart
- Can complete purchases
- Can manage their cart

### 👑 **Admin Users**
- Can view all products
- Cannot add to cart (shows "Manage Product" button)
- Cannot complete purchases
- Can manage products (future feature)

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Public Product Viewing**
```javascript
// Use public marketplace endpoint for everyone
const endpoint = 'http://localhost:8080/api/warehouse/marketplace/products';

const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // Only add Authorization header if user is logged in
    ...(token && { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` })
  }
});
```

### 2. **Universal Add to Cart**
```javascript
// Everyone except admins can add to cart
{isAdmin ? (
  <button className="Manage Product">Manage Product</button>
) : (
  <AddToCartButton 
    productId={product.id}
    productName={product.name}
    className="w-full"
  />
)}
```

### 3. **Role-Based Purchase Restrictions**
```javascript
// Check if user can complete purchases
if (user && user.role === 'ADMIN') {
  setToastMessage('Admins cannot purchase products. You can only manage them.');
  return;
}
```

## Benefits of Open Shopping Model

🎯 **Better User Experience**: Anyone can browse and explore products  
🛒 **Increased Sales**: More users can add items to cart  
👥 **Inclusive Shopping**: Farmers can buy from other farmers  
🔒 **Controlled Purchases**: Only authorized users can complete transactions  
👑 **Admin Separation**: Admins focus on management, not shopping  

## API Endpoints Used

| Function | Endpoint | Access |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **View Products** | `/api/warehouse/marketplace/products` | Public (everyone) |
| **Add to Cart** | `/api/buyer/cart/add` | Authenticated users (except admins) |
| **View Cart** | `/api/buyer/cart` | Authenticated users (except admins) |
| **Checkout** | `/api/buyer/checkout` | Authenticated users (except admins) |

## User Flow Examples

### Guest User Flow
1. Browse products → See "Add to Cart" buttons
2. Click "Add to Cart" → Redirected to login
3. Login as buyer/farmer → Can now add to cart
4. Complete purchase → Success!

### Admin User Flow
1. Browse products → See "Manage Product" buttons
2. Click "Manage Product" → Future: Product management interface
3. Cannot add to cart → Clear admin role indication

### Buyer/Farmer User Flow
1. Browse products → See "Add to Cart" buttons
2. Click "Add to Cart" → Item added successfully
3. View cart → Manage quantities
4. Checkout → Complete purchase
